# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this Prework Study Guide webpage to be a tool to help boot camp students going through their prework material. This webpage contains notes about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript to aid students learning these prework topics.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
